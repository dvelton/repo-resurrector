# Dead Repo Resurrector - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: To identify abandoned but promising open source repositories and facilitate their revival by connecting them with motivated developers.
- **Success Indicators**: Number of repos successfully adopted, user engagement metrics (return rate, time spent), number of active users.

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Many valuable open source projects become abandoned despite having potential usefulness, resulting in wasted code and unfixed issues.
- **User Context**: Developers looking to contribute to open source, find projects to maintain, or rescue valuable tools they depend on.
- **Critical Path**: Login → Browse dead repos → View details → Adopt repository → Track progress
- **Key Moments**: 
  1. Discovering a repository that matches user interests/skills
  2. Successfully adopting a repository and making initial contact
  3. Seeing progress on the leaderboard after successful resurrections

5. **Repo Suggestions**
   - Functionality: AI-generated summaries and modernization suggestions for each repository
   - Purpose: Help users understand projects quickly and identify specific improvement opportunities
   - Success criteria: Accurate summaries and actionable modernization suggestions

6. **Leaderboard**
   - Functionality: Track and display users by adoption and improvement metrics

   - Success criteria: Accurate tracking, meaningful ranking system, user engagement

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Inspiration, purpose, community
- **Design Personality**: Professional yet friendly, emphasizing collaboration and restoration
- **Visual Metaphors**: Revival, growth, collaboration (plants/gardens, restoration)
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Moderately rich interface with clear focus on repository data and actions

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Complementary palette centered around green (life/growth) and purple (creativity)
- **Primary Color**: Forest green (#2d6a4f) - represents growth, revival, and sustainability
- **Secondary Colors**: Slate blue (#5e60ce) for interactive elements, warm gray (#64748b) for UI structure
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant teal (#14b8a6) for calls-to-action and highlighting important actions
- **Color Psychology**: Green evokes growth and revival, purple suggests creativity and quality, teal creates energy and focus
- **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations will maintain WCAG AA compliance with sufficient contrast
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (#fafafa) / Foreground (#1a202c)
  - Card (#ffffff) / Card-foreground (#1a202c)
  - Primary (#2d6a4f) / Primary-foreground (#ffffff)
  - Secondary (#5e60ce) / Secondary-foreground (#ffffff)
  - Accent (#14b8a6) / Accent-foreground (#ffffff)
  - Muted (#f1f5f9) / Muted-foreground (#64748b)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Clean sans-serif for UI elements, slightly more distinctive sans-serif for headings
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear size differential between headings (1.25rem+) and body text (1rem)
- **Font Personality**: Professional, readable, modern
- **Readability Focus**: Generous line height (1.6), maximum line length of 80ch, adequate paragraph spacing
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent font weights across similar element types
- **Which fonts**: Inter for body text, Outfit for headings
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts highly legible at various sizes, with excellent screen rendering

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Repository cards as focal points, clear CTAs for adoption
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between content blocks for clarity
- **Grid System**: 12-column responsive grid with appropriate gutters
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with smart adaptation of complex data displays
- **Content Density**: Moderate density for repository listings, with expandable details

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions to indicate state changes and progress
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary animations for user actions, secondary for system responses
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Animations will be functional rather than decorative, with subtle flourishes for achievement recognition

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for repositories, dialogs for detailed views, tabs for organizing different data views
- **Component Customization**: Custom styling for repository cards to show staleness metrics visually
- **Component States**: Clear hover/active states for interactive elements with appropriate feedback
- **Icon Selection**: GitHub-themed icons where appropriate, plus revival/growth themed icons
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary (adoption buttons), secondary (filtering controls), tertiary (information displays)
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4px base unit (0.25rem) with tailwind's spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stack cards vertically, collapse detailed data into expandable sections

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with reusable patterns
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color palette, typography scale, spacing system, component variants
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card sizing, spacing, and interactive element placement
- **Brand Alignment**: Emphasize community and collaboration in visual language

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text elements (4.5:1 for normal, 3:1 for large text)

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: API rate limiting, false positives in repository identification
- **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful degradation for API failures, clear error messaging
- **Technical Constraints**: GitHub API limitations, performance considerations for large repository data

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: System should handle increasing numbers of users and repositories
- **Testing Focus**: Repository identification accuracy, authentication flow, adoption process
- **Critical Questions**: How to handle repos that are revived through other means? How to measure successful resurrection?

## Reflection
- This approach uniquely combines automated identification with human judgment and motivation to target the most promising abandoned projects.
- We've assumed users will want to contribute to projects they don't personally use, which should be validated.
- Making this exceptional would involve creating a true community of maintainers who support each other beyond just the initial resurrection.
